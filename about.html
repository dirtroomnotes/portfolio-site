    Well, Hello there! I‚Äôm Traci, a Project Manager and Business Analyst who loves turning big, messy projects into clear, successful outcomes. For over seven years, I‚Äôve worked across SaaS, ERP, cloud, IoT, and infrastructure, helping teams cut through the noise, find focus, and feel confident in what they deliver. My approach is simple: create clarity, build trust, and empower people. I thrive in environments where collaboration is key, and I enjoy mentoring teams, guiding them through complex projects, and celebrating successes along the way.
</p>
<p class="text-gray-800 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
    I love finding ways to grow personally and professionally. I‚Äôm pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Data Analytics and bring perspective from my Associate of Arts in Psychology, which I love applying to think outside the box and find better ways to support my team and clients. Along with my certifications (PMP, CAPM, and ScrumMaster), these experiences reflect both my technical expertise and my people-first mindset. I also enjoy exploring new tools and techniques, from automation strategies to process optimizations, to ensure every project I touch delivers meaningful results. I often share these insights and lessons on my blog, connecting my professional experiences with creative problem-solving strategies.
</p>
<p class="text-gray-800 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
    Outside of work, I‚Äôm driven by curiosity and creativity. My pup Sonnie üêæ makes sure I get fresh air and a healthy dose of play, music üé∂ is my constant source of inspiration, and time with family keeps me grounded. I love discovering new hobbies, whether it‚Äôs experimenting with tech projects at home, diving into a good book, or exploring local art and culture. Sharing what I learn through my blog allows me to connect with others and contribute to the broader community of curious minds.
</p>
<p class="text-gray-800 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
    I‚Äôm a big believer that personal passions fuel professional success. Whether it‚Äôs tackling a challenging project, brainstorming creative solutions, or coaching a teammate through a tricky workflow, I bring the same energy, empathy, and curiosity that drives my life outside of work. I enjoy collaborating with teams who value clarity, accountability, and innovation, and I‚Äôm always looking for opportunities to learn from others while sharing my own insights.
</p>
<p class="text-gray-800 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-10">
    Thanks for stopping by! Take a look at my projects and blog, and feel free to connect, whether it‚Äôs about tech, music, family, Sonnie, or any creative idea you want to explore. I‚Äôm always open to conversations, collaboration, or just sharing a laugh along the way.
</p>
