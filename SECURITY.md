# Security Policy

This is my personal site and sandbox, things might break, features may vanish, and security updates aren’t guaranteed.  

If you happen to find a bug, glitch, or security issue, I’d love to hear about it! Please email me at **contact.traci.portfolio@gmail.com** rather than opening a public issue. 
I’ll do my best to respond in a reasonable time, but keep in mind this is a hobby project, so I might not be able to fix everything right away.  

Basically: explore, have fun, and reach out if you discover something important, just be respectful, and know that support is casual and informal.
